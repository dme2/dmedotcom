I fucking suck at interviewing. I come across as a retard each and every time I have to sit there and explain my thought process. I have no idea what my thought process even is. I don't know fucking thoughts come from (who does???). The best hint I can gather of the inner workings is that it's a completely stochastic process. Except unlike stocks (or very much like stocks, depending on your disposition) there is no differential equation that can even begin to model the process. Perhaps this is due to lifelong afflictions (ADHD,Anxiety) or maybe I am truly just fucked.

I don't mind having to solve something but just give me a fucking minute to think about it before running my mouth. Spouting every thought that comes to mind goes against every fiber of my goddamm being. Even if I were to push myself to bring up every single thought I would just sound like a babbling schizoid.
