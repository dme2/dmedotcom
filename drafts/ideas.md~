Structure and Interpretation of Programming Interview Questions 
- break down and explain several effective techniques of solving these problmes
  -practical (but also philosophical e.g. running the thing is not as important as solving thething.)
  - Algorithms: DP, Recursion, Traversing/Searching
  - structures: maps,graphs,arrays,lists
  - see thru the question
  
Thinking Mathematically 
    -semi-satirical post regarding moving things up the strucutre ladder (into Groups, Fields, Types, etc.) vs. A Deep Undestanding of The Thing Itself
    
An Even Faster Way to Find Pitch
    - Analyize the modified MPM algorithm's runtime
    - Write out Mathematically and compare
