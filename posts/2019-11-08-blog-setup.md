title: Setting up a blog with Hakyll (and nginx)
---

For my first Real Blog Post I figured that I'd just go over how I went about setting this thing up. Despite using hakyll (as apposed to something like jakyll or hugo) and semi-self-hosting this website (on digital ocean), the whole process was actually rather simple. 

As it's name implies, hakyll is the Haskell answer to Go's Jakyll. It's a good static site generator, but it's main appeal is that it relies on pandoc for compiling and transforming files.
